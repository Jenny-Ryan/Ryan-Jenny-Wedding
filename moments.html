                    <p>‚ÄúIt all started when my roommate pushed me to talk to a cute guy in our class. I was hesitant at
                        first,
                        but the more she talked about him, the more intrigued I became. It wasn't until we met at a
                        common
                        friend's party that I finally mustered up the courage to message him. I spent hours crafting the
                        perfect
                        message, hoping it
                        would catch his
                        attention.

                        <br>
                        We started to hang out, it quickly became apparent that my English skills were...let's just say,
                        a
                        work
                        in progress. Our conversations were limited to a few basic phrases, and I'm pretty sure I
                        butchered
                        some
                        common idioms along the way. But hey, you know what they say: love knows no language barriers

                        "I was a first-year master's student at Syracuse University, and I had a statistics class with
                        Jenny. I
                        remember thinking she was really cute, so I mustered up the courage to ask her if she wanted to
                        study
                        together in the back of the library. At the time, Jenny's English wasn't very fluent due to her
                        Chinese
                        background, so I don't think she understood me very well. But that didn't deter me!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        From there, I started introducing Jenny to the friends I grew up with, and we began spending
                        more
                        and
                        more time together. It got to the point where she practically lived with me at my parents'
                        house!
                        Jenny's
                        kindness shone through from the very beginning, and she's honestly the kindest person I've ever
                        met.
                        Anyone who has had the pleasure of knowing her can attest to that without a doubt.And now, here
                        we
                        are,
                        ready
                        to take the next step in our journey as a married couple. It all started with
                        a simple invitation to study, and I can't wait to see what our future holds. Join us as we
                        celebrate
                        our
                        love and embark on this new chapter together!"
